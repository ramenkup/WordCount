Consider the Java API documentation. Each class starts with a (usually lengthy) description of the purpose of the class and how it fits into the Java class hierarchy. That's a block comment. Each method has a similar block of documentation associated with it. Without these comments, the programmer would have a hard time using the class or its method effectively. You should do the same for your code. Java's API is documented using a commenting style that is compatible with a tool called Javadoc. That's great for documentation that lots of people will be referencing, but not so good for commenting one-off student programs. So, we don't use Javadoc, but we do require that you write complete, well-structured block comments for your classes and methods. 

In addition, you need to place a block comment ahead of the class containing your main() method. We call this an `external' block comment because it replaces the external documentation that would normally accompany a complete program.
