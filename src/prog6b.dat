One dark night outside a small town in Minnesota, a fire started inside
the local chemical plant and in a blink it exploded into massive flames.

The alarm went out to all the fire departments from miles around.
When the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical
company president rushed to the fire chief and said, "All of our secret
formulas are in the vault in the center of the plant. They must be saved.
I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact."
But the roaring flames held the firefighters off. Soon more fire
departments had to be called in as the situation became desperate. As the
firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000
to the fire department who could bring out the company's secret files.

From the distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into
sight. It was the nearby Norwegian rural township volunteer fire company
composed mainly of Norwegians over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement,
the little run-down fire engine, operated by these Norwegians, passed all
the newer sleek engines parked outside the plant.....and drove straight
into the middle of the inferno.

Outside the other firemen watched as the Norwegian old timers jumped off
and began to fight the fire with a performance and effort never seen
before. Within a short time, the Norske old timers had extinguished the
fire and saved the secret formulas.

The grateful chemical company president joyfully announced that for such a
superhuman feat he was upping the reward to $200,000, and walked over to
personally thank each of the brave, though elderly, Norske fire fighters.

The local TV news reporters rushed in after capturing the event on film
asking, "What are you going to do with all that money?" "Vell," said Ole
Larsen, the 70-year-old fire chief, "da furst thing ve do is fix da brakes."
